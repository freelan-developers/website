A VPN client, done right
========================

Freelan is a **free**, **open-source**, **multi-platform**, **peer-to-peer** VPN software that abstracts a LAN over the Internet. It works on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.

Whether you want to connect the computers of your family, play an old LAN-only game with your friends, or give a privileged access to your private network to your collaborators, freelan will do the job perfectly.
