<h2 id="two-hosts">Two hosts</h2>

<p>This section explains how to configure freelan to allow two hosts, <strong>alice</strong> and <strong>bob</strong> to communicate with one-another.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>Alice and Bob both run a computer at their respective homes. They both have a NAT router that connects them to the Internet.</p>
<p>They would like to establish a VPN tunnel between their computers to exchange securely pictures of <a href="http://www.lolcats.com/">lolcats</a>.</p>
<p>Alice is running a Windows Seven computer. Her public Internet hostname is <code>alice.someisp.com</code>. She has set-up a NAT port-forwarding on her router that redirects <code>12000/UDP</code> to <code>12000/UDP</code> on her computer.</p>
<p>Bob is running Debian Linux. His public Internet hostname is <code>bob.someotherisp.com</code>. He has set-up a NAT port-forwarding on his router that redirects <code>30000/UDP</code> to <code>12000/UDP</code> on his computer.</p>
<p>Alice and Bob agreed that that alice should have the address <code>9.0.0.1</code> inside the VPN tunnel and that Bob should have <code>9.0.0.2</code>.</p>
<p>Alice is in charge of the certificate authority. She signed Bob's certificate and gave him the CA certificate file. They generated the following files:</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>ca.crt</code> - The CA certificate. Available on both computers.</li>
		<li><code>ca.key</code> - The CA private key. Alice generated it and keeps it offline on a laptop.</li>
		<li><code>alice.crt</code> - Alice's certificate, signed by the CA. Available on both computers.</li>
		<li><code>alice.key</code> - Alice's private key. Available to Alice only.</li>
		<li><code>bob.crt</code> - Bob's certificate, signed by the CA. Available on both computers.</li>
		<li><code>bob.key</code> - Bob's private key. Available to Bob only.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
